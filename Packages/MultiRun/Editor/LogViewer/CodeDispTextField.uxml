    <ui:TextField picking-mode="Ignore" text="In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum (/ˌlɔː.rəm ˈɪp.səm/) is a placeholder text &#10;commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without &#10;relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final &#10;copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, &#10;which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the &#10;meaning of the text influencing the design.&#10;&#10;Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a &#10;1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, &#10;added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. The first two words &#10;themselves are a truncation of &apos;dolorem ipsum&apos; (&apos;pain itself&apos;).&#10;&#10;Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, &#10;when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.[1] Lorem ipsum &#10;was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic &#10;and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other &#10;popular word processors, including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted &#10;Lorem ipsum,[2] as have many LaTeX packages,[3][4][5] web content managers such as &#10;Joomla! and WordPress, and CSS libraries such as Semantic UI.[6] " name="CodeDispTextField" is-delayed="false" readonly="true" style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -unity-font: url(&apos;project://database/Packages/com.bitwes.multirun/Fonts/Source_Code_Pro/static/SourceCodePro-Regular.ttf?fileID=12800000&amp;guid=31eeb5b101c19463f8d8254f1d3dedba&amp;type=3#SourceCodePro-Regular&apos;); opacity: 1; color: rgb(34, 195, 0);" />
